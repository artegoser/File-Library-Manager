## 1. Before starting the compiler, install the libraries from requirements.txt. Python version 3.6

The compiled version is in the dist folder. Move the FLIM.exe file from the dist folder here

## 2.1 Adding to PATH FLIM.exe

[Installation guide](https://github.com/artegoser/Large-File-Library/wiki/installation "installation guide")

## 2.2 add_to_path.bat (not_recommended)

	Attention! This solution can be destructive as Windows 
	truncates the PATH to 1024 characters. Make sure 
	to back up your PATH before making any changes.


***FLIM is not responsible for your actions***  


**(not recommended)If you want to automatically add FLIM to the system PATH variable, run add_to_path.bat as administrator, the variable is set only to the current user**
